I am a Research Assistant in the [Computer Science Department](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/science/academic-programs/computer-science.html) at [NYU Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/), where I work at the intersection of natural language processing and information visualization. My research involves developing applications that analyze large datasets, derive insights through advanced AI techniques, and present findings in compelling visual formats. I work specifically with [Prof. Djellel](https://dedcode.github.io/) and collaborate closely with other research teams at [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/), contributing to cutting-edge research in AI and information visualization.

In 2023, I completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/). My experience also includes a software engineering internship at [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/), where I collaborated with experienced engineers to build a reporting system that enhanced the efficiency and productivity of on-call engineers.
